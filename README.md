Note: All repositories labled with "codecademy-" in their names are created using step by step tutorials by CodeCademy. They are not 100% my work.
# CodeCademy Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts project
## Introduction
This is the "Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts" project from the CodeCademy Full-Stack Engineer Skill Path. It contains a simple website made with HTML & CSS.
## Who is this for?
I'm pretty new to HTML & CSS and this repository has mainly been created for me to get better at git. If you are another CodeCademy learner feel free to look at, criticize and review the website. The Layout, sizes and fonts have been specified in the CodeCademy course.
## Images
Although I was able to locate some proof of most of these images being allowed to publish for me here I still decided to remove them. If you are a member of the course as well just find them and drag them into the images folder.
